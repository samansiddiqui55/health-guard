   cd health-guard
## üöÄ Usage Guide

1. **Symptom Analysis**  
   - Open `Symptoms.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.  
   - Run the cells to explore and preprocess symptom-related data from the provided CSV files.  

2. **Model Training & Evaluation**  
   - Open `MultipleBinaryClassifier.ipynb` to train and evaluate a multi-binary classification model.  
   - Open `Multiclassifier.ipynb` to train and evaluate a multiclass disease prediction model.  
   - Review accuracy, precision, recall, and prediction outputs inside the notebook.  

3. **Chatbot Interface**  
   - Open `LLMChatBot.ipynb`.  
   - Run the notebook to interact with a language model‚Äìbased chatbot.  
   - Input symptoms or questions and receive disease predictions or recommendations.
